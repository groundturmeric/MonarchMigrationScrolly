            <!-- <h1>Monarch Migration</h1> -->
            <h2>a symbol resilience</h2>

            <p>The annual migration of millions of Monarch butterflies across central and eastern U.S.
                and southern Canada is one of the most fascinating phenomena we can still witness today.
            </p>


            <p>However, over the last few years, this fragile living wonder has been in affected by various
                human activities such as agricultural farming changing grasslands into farms, the use of herbicides,
                deforestation, all of which also contribute to the loss of native milkweed plants, an essential host
                plant for the Monarch.

                announced the total forest area occupied by overwintering monarch colonies today. Eleven (11) colonies
                were
                located this winter season with a total area of 2.83 hectares, a 53.22% decrease from the previous

                Despite all these challenges, the Monarch butterflies successfully complete a
                most epic annual cycle of migration accomplished in about 4 generations!

            <p>
                Finding data from this epic migration is very challenging since Monarch Butterflies are not easy to
                track.
                I was excited to come across this crowd sourced data set from “Journey North” where users contribute by
                reporting sightings,
                this geo located data adds a new lens to observe these migrations throughout the seasons.

                    of milkweed from late March through April in the southern

                    <br>Diapause is a delayed maturity; these young Adults do not reproduce right after
                    they emerge. as temperatures decrease and daylengths shorten at the end of the summer,
                    instead of mating and laying eggs, they spend their time drinking nectar and clustering
                    together in nighttime roosts in preparation for their long journey south.

            <!-- <h2> Conclusion </h2> -->
            <p>Monarchs that overwinter can survive up to 9 months. In contrast,
                breeding adult monarchs in the spring and summer months need plentiful
                nectar plants to fuel their reproduction, and usually live only about 1 month.
